### Howdy!

<a></a>
 
Welcome to my personal website - I use this to share information about current projects and personal interests. Amost everything I work on is hosted on my [GitHub]({{ site.github.owner_url }}) so I welcome to you to take a look there if you are interested about anything in particular.

Feel free to take a look around, and if you want to know more about my background, head over to [About Me](./about.html). I welcome any questions and also love to connect so don't hesitate to reach out through email, LinkedIn, or any other way!

PS: I have no background in WebDev - I built this website using a customized Jekyll theme and am slowly teaching myself CSS, HTML, and related tools to improve this site.
