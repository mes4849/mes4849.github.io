### Howdy!
This website is a personal project of mine - I share technical projects I am working on (all hosted on my GitHub) and also share some life related posts.

My personal hobbies include working with MCU's (Arduino, Raspberri Pi), Data Science, and anything related to trading equities. I welcome you to read through the different pages, especially 'About Me' to learn more about my background!

Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or email, I am always looking forwards to connecting with others for professional or personal reasons!
