### Howdy!

Welcome to my personal website - I use this to share information about current projects and personal interests. Amost everything I work on is hosted on my GitHub so I welcome to you to take a look there if you are interested about anything in particular.

I feel I should also disclose that I have no background with HTML or CSS so this website in itself is also an ongoing project. It is built using a customized Jekyll theme and hosted by GitHub. Feel free to take a look around, and if you want to know more about my background, head over to [About Me](./about.html). I welcome any questions and also love to connect so don't hesitate to reach out through email, LinkedIn, or any other way!
