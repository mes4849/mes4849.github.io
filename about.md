</center>

Howdy, I am a Loud & Proud member of the Fighting Texas Aggie class of 2019! I currently work at AIG, doing data analytics and SailPoint development within our Identity and Access Management division. I have a passion for applying my critical thinking and strong programming foundations to find innovative and efficient approaches for our deliverables.
<p></p>
My work deals extensively with Python (pandas, numpy, cx_oracle), SQL, as well as leveraging BI tools like PowerBI to communicate insights. In addition, some hobbies include investing & trading securities, working on my cars, and reading.
<p></p>
I am constantly looking at ways of growing my career and becoming better at what I do. I appreciate all the opportunities that come my way and am always open to professional and personal connections.
