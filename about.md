## Education

**Texas A&M University | 2019**
- BS in Aerospace Engineering
- Minors in Computer Science & Math

I am graduating from TAMU this December (12/19) as an Aerospace engineering student. I have developed strong interests in fields that leverage strong programming skills throughout my undergrad experience, specifically areas like GNC where I can apply my foundational aerospace education through practical computer science applications.
