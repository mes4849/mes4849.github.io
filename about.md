** HOWDY**
I am a current senior at Texas A&M where I will be graduating from this December (12/19) with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. Within aerospace, I have strong interests in fields where I can apply my strong programming background, such as GNC, and also enjoy systems engineering. Outside of this, I have developed a strong interest in data science, with applications to business intelligence and cybersecurity.
