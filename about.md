### Howdy

I am Texas A&M Former Student, class of 2019. I currently work at AIG, doing data analytics and SailPoint development within our Identity and Access Management division. I have a passion for applying my critical thinking and strong programming foundations to find innovative and efficient approaches for our deliverables.
<p></p>
I work extensively with Python (pandas, numpy, cx_oracle), SQL, and am starting to leverage the power of Django to create a more accessible and automated platform to share analysis insights.
