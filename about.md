</center>

Howdy, I am a Loud & Proud member of the Fighting Texas Aggie class of 2019! I currently work at AIG, doing data analytics and security engineering. I have a passion for applying my critical thinking and strong technical background to find innovative and efficient solutions.
<p></p>

I work extensively with Python - especially Pandas & NumPy, SQL, PowerShell, and PowerBI. I am effective in transforming insights to action, and find novel ways to get the data we need.
<br>
In my free time I enjoy working on cars, woodworking, and fimrly believe in continuing education.

<p></p>
I am constantly looking at ways of growing my career and becoming better at what I do. I appreciate all the opportunities that come my way and am always open to professional and personal connections.
